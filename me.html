               « If Man thinks of the Whole as consisting of independent fragments,
               then that is how his mind will tend to function. But if he can include
               everything in a coherent and harmonious way as part of an indivisible,
               uninterrupted and endless globality, then his mind will tend to develop in a similar way ».
